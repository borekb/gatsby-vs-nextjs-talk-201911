# Gatsby vs. Next.js

GatsbyJS meetup<br />
Prague, 14 Nov 2019

# I am a _software engineer_

---

## My websites in the past:

- **Plain HTML** for presentational sites
- **WordPress** for blogs

---

# It was both ü§ò and ü§ï

---

# 2013: React ‚öõÔ∏è

---

# My initial reactions:

1. This approach to building UIs feels _right_.
2. Let's build _applications_ with it.

---

# 2014‚Äì2017:

- People are building _SPAs_ with ‚öõÔ∏è
- For sites, I'm still using WordPress & plain HTML

---

(I thought https://pin.gy/cli/ was pretty cool)

---

# 2018: Gatsby explodes üí•

---

### ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è SPEEED ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

---

### no servers to ~~manage~~ hack

---

### React ‚öõÔ∏è

---

# What's not to like?

<div style={{ width: '150px' }}>

## 1. Gatsby's SSR is a "lie"

## 2. Heavy bet on GraphQL

<Notes>

- I personally love GraphQL
- It's an interesting abstraction
  - Maybe useful
  - Maybe unnecessary

</Notes>

---

<div style={{ fontSize: '0.5em' }}>

```jsx
export const query = graphql`
  query {
    fileName: file(relativePath: { eq: "images/myimage.jpg" }) {
      childImageSharp {
        fluid(maxWidth: 400, maxHeight: 250) {
          ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;
```

</div>
