# Gatsby vs. Next.js

GatsbyJS meetup<br />
Prague, 14 Nov 2019

---

## I am a _software engineer_ 

---

## ... forced to make websites

---

2000's & most of 2010's:

blogs → **WordPress**<br/>
simple sites → **plain HTML**

---

# It was both ✌️ and 🤕

---

# WordPress

✅ Complex sites quickly<br/>
✅ Themes & plugins<br/>
✅ Lots of resources<br/>

---

# WordPress

🙁 Ugly old codebase<br/>
🐌 Slow by default<br/>
😭 No version control<br/>

---

# Plain old HTML

Confession: I actually enjoyed it

---

# Plain old HTML

... but was really unproductive with it

---

In the meantime, **React** ⚛️ happened

---

I quickly fell in love

---

We adopted it for VersionPress' UI in 2015

---

... and built a VP.com dashboard with it

---

### We were building _apps_ in React

---

But _websites_ were still **WordPress** & **plain HTML**

---

# 2018: Gatsby explodes 💥

## <MiddleImg><GatsbyLogo /></MiddleImg>

---

I'm trying it for our [VP.com website](https://versionpress.com)

---

### ❤️❤️❤️ SPEEED ❤️❤️❤️

---

### no servers to ~~manage~~ hack

---

### React ⚛️

---

New kind of experience ⇒ questioning old truths

---

### 🤔 Why do we build SPAs?

---

<div style={{ fontSize: '0.5em' }}>

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/static/vendors.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/static/app.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

</div>

### Why are we serving this to our users?

---

But we kept at it.

---

# 2019: New project

---

<div style={{ width: '150px' }}>
  <ShoptetLogo />
</div>

---

## Would Gatsby be a good fit?

---

### By "SSR", Gatsby means build-time pre-rendering

Dear sirs, SSR !== pre-rendering. Best regards, Borek

---

<!-- Next.js -->

![Next.js](https://assets.zeit.co/image/upload/v1538361091/repositories/next-js/next-js.png)

---

## It felt quite poor in comparison:

<div style={{textAlign: 'left'}}>

- Barebones (no plugin system, no themes, ...)<br/>
- No universal data layer via GraphQL<br/>
- Fewer optimizations out of the box<br/>

</div>

---

## But it had **SSR**

and eshops abso-freakin-lutely need SSR

---

## Next.js also felt better than other choices

---

# So we tried it

---

# ... and it felt really good!

(see the pattern? ❤️❤️❤️)

---

Being **barebones** was a benefit for Shoptet's platform

---

**Data fetching** however we wanted

(we chose GraphQL anyway 😄)

---

The **best runtime model** I've seen to date

ZEIT Now deployments 😍

# So...

## When to use which?

---

1. For **static sites**, I'd use Gatsby <SmallImg><GatsbyLogo /></SmallImg>

---

# <SmallImg><GatsbyLogo /></SmallImg>

<div style={{textAlign: 'left'}}>

- Easily combine data from multiple sources
    - Markdown
    - WordPress
    - \`gatsby-source-*\`
- Many plugins available
- Great performance

</div>

---

2. For **apps**, I'd use Next <SmallImg><NextLogo /></SmallImg>

---

# <SmallImg><NextLogo /></SmallImg>

<div style={{textAlign: 'left'}}>

- See e.g. Kap
- Next.js has almost no downsides <br/>compared to plain React app / CRA

</div>

---

3. For **complex / dynamic sites**, clearly Next <SmallImg><NextLogo /></SmallImg>

---

# <SmallImg><NextLogo /></SmallImg>

<div style={{textAlign: 'left'}}>

- Both pre-rendering (ala Gatsby) _and_ SSR
- Not too complex, not too simple
- Super-powers when combined with Now ▲

</div>

---

# But most importantly...

---

# Both are ⚛️

---

# ⚛️

One set of skills<br/>
Code is 95% the same<br/>
Both built on React, Babel, webpack, ...

---

(4. For a **slide deck**, I'd use Gatsby <SmallImg><GatsbyLogo /></SmallImg> & mdx-deck 😄. [Repo](https://github.com/borekb/gatsby-vs-nextjs-talk-201911).)

# Thank you!
